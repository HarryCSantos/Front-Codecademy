            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-scholl fonts (also called typefaces) which have been adapted for use on digital displays. However, I would like to highlight a few of my favorites fonts that were created with screens in mind</p>

                <h2>Serif</h2>
                <p>Serifs are the small features at the end of strokes within letters. These features are <strong>function as well as decorative</strong>. Serif fonts are widely used for body text (eg. articles) because they are considered easier to read than sans-serif fonts in print.</p>
                <p>Serif fonts can often create a feeling of traditionalism and antiquity, due to their commom use in printed materials for many years.</p>
